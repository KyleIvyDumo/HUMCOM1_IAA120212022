            <p>	The history of Paris dates back to approximately 259 BC, with the Parisii, a Celtic tribe settled on the banks of the Seine. In 52 BC, the fishermen village was conquered by the Romans, founding a Gallo-Roman town called Lutetia.
                The city changed its name to Paris during the fourth century.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Many centuries ago when the first settlers in Paris were scrubbing their clothes on the muddy banks of the Seine, the city that would be founded on that spot was not referred to as Paris. Paris’s original name was Lutetia Parisiorum (called Lutèce in French)  and the settlers there were Celts known as the “Parisii.” It is commonly believed that “Lutetia” comes from the Latin word lutum meaning "mud" or "swamp". So the elegant, glittering city that we all know and love, most likely was first known as mud town of the Parisii.</li>
                <li>Île de la Cité is the birthplace of Paris</li>
                <li>Pont Neuf means “New Bridge,” so named by King Henry III, who ordered its construction in 1578. He named it “New Bridge” because it had very modern features for its time. It was the first bridge without houses built on it, the widest bridge in Paris (for awhile), and the first to have pavement, which made it an ideal place to socialize.</li>
                <li>One of the biggest holidays in France is Bastille Day on July 14th. Colourful fireworks illuminate the Eiffel Tower, armoured tanks trundle down the Champs-Elysees in a military parade, low-flying jet planes rip through the sky, spouting blue, white and red smoke in their wake – all to celebrate the storming of the prison Bastille in 1789 and the release of its prisoners. Bastille was known for holding political prisoners, especially those openly critical of the monarchy. But on the day Bastille was actually stormed, there were no political prisoners of significance in the jail. In fact, there were only 7 prisoners – and four of them had been jailed for check-forging.</li>

                <dt style="color:#924e4e;" id="eiffelTower"><strong>Eiffel Tower</strong></dt>
                <dd>The Eiffel Tower was built by Gustave Eiffel for the 1889 Exposition Universelle, which was to celebrate the 100th year anniversary of the French Revolution. Its construction in 2 years, 2 months and 5 days was a veritable technical and architectural achievement. "Utopia achieved", a symbol of technological prowess, at the end of the 19th Century it was a demonstration of French engineering, and a defining moment of the industrial era. As France’s symbol in the world, and the showcase of Paris, today it welcomes almost 7 million visitors a year, making it the most visited monument that you have to pay for in the world.</dd>
                <dt style="color:#924e4e;" id="louvre"><strong>The Louvre</strong></dt>
                <dd>Louvre, in full Louvre Museum or French Musée du Louvre, official name Great Louvre or French Grand Louvre, national museum and art gallery of France, housed in part of a large palace in Paris that was built on the right-bank site of the 12th-century fortress of Philip Augustus. It is the world’s most-visited art museum, with a collection that spans work from ancient civilizations to the mid-19th century.</dd>
                <dt style="color:#924e4e;" id="arcDeTriomphe"><strong>Arc de Triomphe</strong></dt>
                <dd>The Arc de Triomphe Paris, the most monumental of all triumphal arches, was built between 1806 and 1836. Even though there were many modifications from the original plans (reflecting political changes and power struggles), the Arch still retains the essence of the original concept which was a powerful, unified symbol for France.</dd>                    
                <dt style="color:#924e4e;" id="eiffelTower"><strong>The Notre-Dame Cathedral</strong></dt>
                <dd>Notre-Dame de Paris, also called Notre-Dame Cathedral, cathedral church in Paris. It is the most famous of the Gothic cathedrals of the Middle Ages and is distinguished for its size, antiquity, and architectural interest.</dd>
                <dt style="color:#924e4e;" id="pontDes"><strong>Pont Des Arts</strong></dt>
                <dd>The Pont des Arts is situated between the Institut de France and the Louvre. Built between 1801 and 1804, it was the first iron bridge in Paris. Reserved for pedestrians, the footbridge makes for a pleasant stroll with family and friends. It is a good location for holiday photos, as it offers fine views of the Seine and its monuments. The bridge is especially popular with couples.</dd>
